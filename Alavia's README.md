## My Learnings
I have found this Git tool very informative. At first, I did not like using it at all but after watching a couple of videos related to its productivity, how it helps you code in group and how you can always go back to your previous code. It is just like Google Docs. I have learned how to check my code over test files and how I can check what is the expected answer. This 'expected answer' and 'my answer' has aided me in rectifying my code many times. 
## My Confusions
My confusions are more related to our Computing for BI course. I am still clueless about making my own logics for the scenarios and writing pseudocodes.
